# Considering a Ph.D. in Computer Science?
## We'll help you decide if it's right for you.

-------

This site collects information about the why and how of getting a Ph.D. in
computer science and closely related disciplines.

It was created by professors who advise Ph.D. students and curent
Ph.D. students.  The information should be useful to anyone compemplating a
pursuing a Ph.D. at a university in the United States or Canada.  It is a free
service of the Computer Science Department at the University of California in
San Diego, and it does not promote any particular school.

We created the site because we find that

1.  The process and implications of getting a Ph.D. vary widely across
    disciplines (e.g., computer science vs. biology vs. history), so
    information specifically about CS is necessary to make a good decision.

2.  High-quality information about getting a Ph.D. in computer science was
    difficult to find, often incorrect, or specific to particular
    Ph.D. programs.
	
3.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that undergraduates at all kinds of schools
    harbor basic misunderstandings about getting a Ph.D. including how to pay
    for it and what research (the focus of a Ph.D.) entails.

4.  Undergraduates do not have access to advisors that can provide accurate,
    first-hand information about getting a Ph.D. in computer science.
	
5.  We suspect that this lack of ready access to good information is a barrier
    to entry to Ph.D. programs for many different groups.

We aim to provide high-quality information directly from people with
first-hand, current, day-to-day knowledge how Ph.D. programs work and why you
might or might not what to get a Ph.D.  

Our hope is that this information will be useful in deciding whether a Ph.D. is
right for you and in guiding you through the application process.

# Key Resources

The site provides four main resources:

1. [The My CS Ph.D. Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/2_wiki.html) --  a set of articles that answer the most common questions students have (or should have) about getting and applying for a Ph.D.
2. [A YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChjPbPsBwexriAwcnHdJTGw) hosting interviews with current Ph.D. students, professors, and Ph.D.-holding computer scientists working industry.
3. [A Blog](_blog.html) with announcement and articles of interest.
4. Links to other resources -- There are many other good resoures about CS Ph.D.s.  We link to them throughout the site.
