## Why this site?

We created the site because we find that

1.  The process and implications of getting a Ph.D. vary widely across
    disciplines (e.g., computer science vs. biology vs. history), so
    information specifically about CS is necessary to make a good decision.

2.  High-quality information about getting a Ph.D. in computer science was
    difficult to find, often incorrect, or specific to particular
    Ph.D. programs.
	
3.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that undergraduates at all kinds of schools
    harbor basic misunderstandings about getting a Ph.D. including how to pay
    for it and what research (the focus of a Ph.D.) entails.

4.  Undergraduates do not have access to advisors that can provide accurate,
    first-hand information about getting a Ph.D. in computer science.
	
5.  We suspect that this lack of ready access to good information is a barrier
    to entry to Ph.D. programs for many different groups.

We aim to provide high-quality information directly from people with
first-hand, current, day-to-day knowledge how Ph.D. programs work and why you
might or might not what to get a Ph.D.
