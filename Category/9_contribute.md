## What to Contribute

If you have an idea for blog post or page that you think might be useful to
people navigating their way to a Ph.D. in CS, we'd love to hear about it.

Some things to keep in mind:

* Despite the existence and usefulness of [school rankings]({% post_url 2021-03-10-school-rankings %}), the site does not promote some schools over others.
* The site loves hearing about your _first-hand_ experience getting, advising, and having a Ph.D. in CS.
* The site loves hearing about useful/relevant data about Ph.D. and analysis thereof.
