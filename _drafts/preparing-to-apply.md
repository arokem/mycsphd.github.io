title: How should I prepare for applying to Ph.D. programs?
---

It is never too late to decide to get Ph.D. in CS.  Starting the process early in your college career is helpful, but not necessary.  The steps you take will depending on when you begin, the process, but regardless of when you start, the goals are the same.

## Identifying Your Goals

Your goal is to be admitted to a CS Ph.D. program, so a good first step is to read about how the [Ph.D. Admissions process works]() and [What parts of the application matter most.]().

The professors evaluating your application will be looking for evidence of:

1.  Aptitude and ability to do research.
2.  CS aptitude and technical skills/experience.

So, preparing yourself (over months or years) to present a strong application means finding ways to demonstrate your aptitude for doing research and your CS skills.

You will develop your aptitude for "research" by seeking out challenging computer science experiences and doing well at them.  You will demonstrate mainly by getting supportive letters of reference from computer scientists and through your "statement of purpose" in your application.

### Understand the Standards Are:  You Probably Have a Good Shot

You do not need to be a stellar student or research prodigy to get into a Ph.D. program.  As I researched this article I found many blog posts and Quora questions that focus (often implicitly or without knowing) on what is necessary to get into the very top CS Ph.D. programs.

From those posts, you might conclude that research experience, excellent grades, flawless GRE scores, and ecstatic letters of recommendation are necessary to get into graduate school.

However, those top 5-10 schools are not the only places to get a Ph.D.  There are many, excellent programs that accept students with strong-but-not-phenomenal applications.  Many new Ph.D. students have not had formal research experience, have imperfect grades, lackluster GREs, or went to know less-well-known schools.

The truth (as I know from many years of reading applications) is that there are not enough stellar Ph.D. applicants to fill the the programs of the merely-excellent Ph.D. programs.

Furthermore, those merely-excellent Ph.D. programs graduate many, very successful Ph.Ds -- and it is perfectly possible for you to be one of them.

### Do I Have to Have "Research Experience" to get into a Ph.D. Program?

No, you do not.  What you need to do is demonstrate that you have aptitude for research.  Doing actual research as an excellent (and the most direct) way to do this, but there are many 
ways to demonstrate that aptitude that don't involve actually _doing_ research.

The fundamental skill you need to do research is the ability to make progress on poorly defined, open-ended problems with limited supervision.  Viewed from this perspective, all of the following might count as "research experience in CS":

1.  Taking one or more classes that involve large, complex projects and doing well with them.
2.  Building a complex project as part of CS student club (e.g., a video game club) or on your own.
3.  Playing a formative role in startup or product group in a company.
4.  Taking independent study courses.

Experience outside of CS is also potentially valuable, if it demonstrates general technical ability, creativity, or entrepreneurial tendencies, since these are all valuable traits in Ph.D. students.

### Getting Good Letters

Regardless of what form your "research experience" takes, you will need someone to vouch for you, because a line on your CV does not show how engaged or successful you were or how much leadership you demonstrated.  And that is what the admission committee wants to know.

Getting a good letter requires the letter writer know you, your skills, and your experience, and that means you will need to have a meaningful relationship with as many of your letter writers as possible.

There are several ways to achieve this:

1.  Work is a professor's research group.
2.  Take one or more classes with the professor, go to office hours, and let them get to know you.
3.  Take a small class from a professor where they can't help but be aware of the quality of your work.
4.  Attend an Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program.

All of these take time and effort, and there are no short cuts.

At smaller schools (e.g., my alma mater) with smaller classes, it is easier to develop the necessary relationships with faculty, since it is hard to "hide" in a small class.  However, at larger schools with larger class sizes, this will take a concerted effort.
