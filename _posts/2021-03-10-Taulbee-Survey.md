title:  Comparing Schools with Taulbee Survey
author: Steven Swanson
category: resource

Every year, the [Computing Research Association](https://cra.org/) (something
like a trade group for computer science research) publishes the [Taulbee
Survey](https://cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey/) which collects a bunch of
information about computer science programs in the US and Canada.  It's a
valuable tool for comparing schools.

It's interesting reading in general (if you're into the inner-workings of CS
research), but it's especially useful for seeing how a particular department
stacks up to its peers in terms Ph.D. student body size, compensation,
diveristy, etc.
