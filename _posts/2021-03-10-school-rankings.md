title:  How To Interpret School Rankings

There are many different rankings available for Ph.D. programs in CS.  They are
each useful, but they are not the most important thing to consider in choosing
where to get your Ph.D.

Ranking are an important tool for figuring where you might want to apply and
which offer you ultimately accept.  However, rankings are just one of several
factors you should use in making this decision, and as a result, there's no
need to obsess about detailed orderings that they provide.

# Where Should I Look for Rankings?

No set of rankings is perfect, since there is no empirical, universal measure
of how "good" a Ph.D. program is.  It is clear, though that some programs are
better than others in that they produce more, higher-quality research, are
better regarded, and/or send their graduates on to more illustrious careers.

Fortunately, most rankings agree generally on ordering of the schools, and a
rough ordering is all you really need.  So, you can safely focus on a couple
reputable rankings and ignore the rest.

I would focus on two rankings sites:

* [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings) -- Probably the best known ranking site for colleges and universities in North America.
* [CS Rankings](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us) -- A CS-specific ranking site based on research productivity and quality as measured by publications in top venues.

# What Rankings Tell You

US News and CS Rankings provide different kinds of information because they use
different methodologies.  The US News
[methodology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/science-schools-methodology)
is "reputation based" in that relies on surveys sent to professors.  The
survey asks the professors to rank the schools based on how good the professor _thinks_
the schools are.  Reputation is important (having a degree from a "big name" can
open doors), but it is not always a good measure of actual quality since good
reputation and persist even after research quality declines.

CS Ranking's [methodology](http://csrankings.org/faq.html) is based on how many
papers the university publishes in the most prestigious CS publication venues.  It
has the advantage that it's completely empirical and transparent.

You should pay attention to both the overall quality of the Ph.D. program and its
quality _in your area_.  These can diverge quite a bit.  For instance, CS rankings
puts Northeastern University as #1 in "Measurement and Performance Analysis" but
#13 overall.  If that were your area of choice, Northeastern might be a better
choice than CMU (#1 overall).

Both CS Rankings and US News provide mechanisms for narrowing the rankings to
particular sub-fields of CS.

# What Rankings Don't Tell You

Rankings cannot answer the most important question you have about when picking
a Ph.D. program: Will I be successful and happy there?

The answer to that question depends significantly on how good a "fit" the
school is for your interests, personality, and life priorities and how well you
"click" with your advisor.  We'll cover those factors in another article.

# How To Use Rankings

Rankings are useful in two ways during the application process.

First, you can use them to choose where to apply.  Use both sites to generate
an ordered list of schools based on overall ranking and ranking in your area of
interest.  Merge those lists together and use the result as a filter out
schools further.

Second, if you have multiple offers of admission, you can use their relative
rankings overall and in your specific field as one factor among many to help
you choose which to accept.

In neither case should you spend too much time worrying them.
