NO!  You **do not** need to get masters degree before enrolling in a
Ph.D. program.  In fact, if you know you want a Ph.D., it is a bad idea to
enroll in a masters program first.

(There's a [video version](https://youtu.be/BWJKhhgPcf4?t=325) of this answer.)

## Having an MS first provides no advantages

Having a masters degree does not give you a significant advantage during
the application process.  Ph.D. programs regularly admit many students who have
just completed their undergraduate degree.

The only practical difference that having an MS will have as you start a
Ph.D. program is that you will have to take fewer classes before you can focus
on research full time.  However, you just spent two years taking classes for
your MS degree so, overall, you don't save anything.

You'll end up with an MS degree in addition to your Ph.D. anyway.
Usually, when you finish the course work for your Ph.D. you incidentally
satisfy the requirements for a masters at the same time.

## Getting an MS first is a bad idea, if you know you want a Ph.D.

There are two reasons enrolling in a MS program first is a bad choice, _if_
your ultimate goal is to get a Ph.D.

First, Ph.D. students [get paid to go to school]({% post_url

Survey]({% post_url 2021-03-10-Taulbee-Survey %}) (Tables M6 and G1) reports
that while 84% of Ph.D. students are fully supported on a TA, RA, or
fellowship, while only 6% of MS are supported (which means that 94% are paying
their own way).

Secondy, the course work requirements for your Ph.D. program may not line up
with the the courses you took for your MS.  In this case, you'll end up taking
_more_ classes if you do the MS first, at a different school.
 
So, if you know you want a Ph.D., apply to and enroll in a Ph.D. program!
