NO! You *do not* need to get a masters degree before enrolling in a Ph.D. program. In fact, if you know you want a Ph.D., it is a bad idea to enroll in a masters program first. Let’s consider the pros and cons.

(There’s a  [video version](https://youtu.be/BWJKhhgPcf4?t=325)  of this answer.)

## Having an MS provides few advantages

Except in one case (see below), having a masters degree does not give you a significant advantage during the application process. Ph.D. programs regularly admit many students who have just completed their undergraduate degree.

The only practical difference that having an MS will have as you start a Ph.D. program is that you will have to take fewer classes before you can focus on research full time. However, you just spent two years taking classes for your MS degree so, overall, you don’t save anything.

You’ll end up with an MS degree in addition to your Ph.D. anyway. Usually, when you finish the course work for your Ph.D. you incidentally satisfy the requirements for a masters at the same time.

## Getting an MS first is usually a bad idea, if you know you want a Ph.D.

There are two reasons that enrolling in a MS program first is a bad choice, _if_ your ultimate goal is to get a Ph.D.

First, Ph.D. students  [get paid to go to school](https://mycsphd.github.io/2021/03/10/how-do-i-pay-for-a-phd.html)  while MS students  [don’t](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Funding-CS-Grad-School/) : The  [Taulbee Survey](https://mycsphd.github.io/2021/03/10/Taulbee-Survey.html)  (Tables M6 and G1) reports that while 84% of Ph.D. students are fully supported on a TA, RA, or fellowship, while only 6% of MS students are supported (which means that 94% are paying their own way).

Second, the course work requirements for your Ph.D. program may not line up with the courses you took for your MS. In this case, you’ll end up taking _more_ classes if you do the MS first, at a different school.

So, if you know you want a Ph.D., apply to and enroll in a Ph.D. program!

## When it might make sense to get an MS first

The one exception to above might be if your undergraduate grades/project experience are not good enough to get into the Ph.D. program you want and you are determined to get a Ph.D.  In this case, you could enroll in an MS program, excel at it, and then apply to Ph.D. programs.

You will likely need to do very well in the MS program since Ph.D. admissions committees often hold MS-holding applicants to a higher standard thn students straight out of undergrad.

Even in this case, though, you should apply to Ph.D. programs too:  You might get in and save yourself the MS tuition money and time.

Another alternative in this situation would be to go work for a couple years and demonstrate your skill and determination while getting paid, and then use that to bolster your Ph.D. applications.
